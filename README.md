Solving Quadratic Equation Using Genetic Algorithm

Problem: find the equation that fits a given dataset

Simplifying assumptions: 

- Assume data can be fit perfectly (zero error) with a quadratic equation (polynomial of 2nd degree)

- Assume our polynomial's coefficients are all integers between -10000 and 10000.

- Assume our data points are represented with integer coordinates
